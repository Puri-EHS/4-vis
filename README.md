# Vis
A framework for rendering HTML-like documents using monospace characters.

**Objectives for Framework**

* Component tree - move around components using arrow keys + press enter to click buttons or enter inputs
* Implement key listener for commands- have set of every keybind we want (ex: cntrl q), every frame, see if any of them intersect
* Each app has an command to open it- you type in the name of the app you want to openn and it opens
* You can also install apps from the framework (similar to package manager or app store where you can install apps)
* We need basic html components- panels/divs, inputs, buttons, dropdowns, hyperlinks, images (maybe, not a first priority), standard text tab. Each of them should have size and position attributes and a z dimension for layers

**Schedule**

- 2 weeks for discord de-make ***(3/21)***
- 4 weeks for geometry dash de-make ***(4/18)***
- 5 weeks for youtube? ***(5/23)***
- any extra time? polishing apps, branching off into solo apps
